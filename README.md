# RC522-RFID
This is really just a RC522 RFID module on a Node MCU.
It was built to detect an RFID tag on the bottom of a toy monkey.
The sensor was inside a desk. The game, based on escape room games, required the monkey
to be placed right over the sensor to unlock a drawer.

The drawer unlock period is set by publishing a time in ms to topic: monkey/t
